    <h6 class="contents">This Web-Page has been made for a 2560px wide monitor.<br>I am still currently under the process of figuring out how to make webpages non-relative to a specific hardware, for example;<br>   - A Phone.<br>   - A TV.<br>- A Computer with a different monitor resolution.<br><br>After all, this webpage is still my very first day on learning to code in HTML, so I grant it a huge success for my coding and programming evolution.<br>Along side the fact I've learned HTML, ive also learned CSS to make my projects using HTML look much prettier than regular HTML, and also JavaScript for coding the websites back-end.<br>I guess you could say, I am a Full Stack Developer Now lol.<br><br>Anyways, for anyone who may accidentaly stumble upon this page due to it being public on github (for a github site), i want to remind you this is my first day learning, and by day, I dont mean I woke up at 7am with a coffee on my desk ready to learn.<br><br>So, after all, I am still young, still in school, and I am teaching myself advanced things a student on GCSEs would probably not be teaching themselves, so Kudos for me for effort!<br><br><br>As I am diving deeper into this hellhole of advanced programming computer science, I will most likely be uploading from home projects to GitHub, so here are the links to my GitHub projects!<br>GitHub Account> https://github.com/IPCMF<br>My first HTML, CSS and JS program> https://github.com/IPCMF/JSCalculator<br><br><br>IPCMF, out.<br>Last Updated: 25/08/24, 00:40 GMT</h6>
